## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

The SoftWave website leverages a modern and scalable tech stack to ensure high performance, maintainability, and a smooth user experience. Below is a breakdown of the technologies used:

### Frontend:
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It helps create dynamic, responsive, and efficient web applications with reusable components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core language behind the website, using modern ES6+ features for clean and maintainable code.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Semantic HTML5 for structuring the website, and CSS3 (with flexbox and grid) for responsive, mobile-first design.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing and ensuring seamless navigation without page reloads.
- **Axios** (or **Fetch API**) (Planned): For making HTTP requests to any future API integrations, like form submissions or data fetching from external sources.
  
### **Styling:**
- **CSS Modules**: Modular and scoped CSS to avoid global style conflicts and improve maintainability.
- **Sass/SCSS** (Planned): A CSS preprocessor that allows for cleaner, more flexible stylesheets using variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **Styled Components** (Optional): A library for writing CSS directly within JavaScript, enhancing the styling process with component-level scoping.

### **State Management:**
- **React Context API**: For managing global state in a lightweight manner across components.
- **Redux** (Planned): If the project scales and requires more complex state management, Redux may be integrated for handling state across larger, more complex components.

### **Testing:**
- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework used to write unit and integration tests, ensuring the reliability of components.
- **React Testing Library**: A testing utility that works with Jest to ensure components behave as expected from a user‚Äôs perspective.

### **Version Control & Collaboration:**
- **Git**: For tracking code changes and collaboration.
- **GitHub**: Repository hosting, version control, and collaboration platform, enabling team members to contribute and track issues.

### **Build & Deployment:**
- **Webpack**: Bundles JavaScript and other static assets efficiently for optimal load times.
- **Babel**: JavaScript compiler that ensures backward compatibility with older browsers.
- **npm**: Node package manager used for managing project dependencies and scripts.
- **Continuous Integration** (Planned): Automated testing and deployment via services like GitHub Actions or Travis CI for smoother development workflows.

### **API Integration (Future Plans):**
- **Node.js**: Backend integration planned for handling form submissions, data collection, and interaction with other services.
- **Express**: Minimalist backend framework (if needed) to handle routing, API development, or server-side logic.

### **Database (Future Plans):**
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that can be integrated for storing client data, form submissions, and user information.
- **Firebase** (Optional): A cloud-based platform for real-time databases and authentication, should the project require user management.

### **Hosting & Deployment:**
- **Netlify** or **Vercel**: Modern cloud platforms for continuous deployment, offering hassle-free React deployment with custom domains, SSL certificates, and automatic updates.
- **GitHub Pages**: An alternative option for static hosting if the website doesn't require dynamic features or backend integration.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
